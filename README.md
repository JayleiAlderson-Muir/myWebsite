# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.

# Example Websites
1. https://thegamingsetup.com/gaming-keyboard/buying-guides/keyboard-switch-chart-table

I have chosen this as an example as it has some very useful imformation as a resource for my own website. 
This is a blog post describing the same kind of data that I want to with my website.
It does a great job of showing this data in a meaningful way, and the page flows nicely.
I believe an issue with this example page is trying to do too much. It might be hard to understand.

This site is actually a store but I think it does a good job of displaying different elements to be used.
The CSS doesn't seem to be dynamic and it's easy to break the look of the page by changing the window size.

This is a great beginner guide. I think I want to do something similar but make it more expansive.
