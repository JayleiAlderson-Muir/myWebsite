I have chosen this as an example as it has some very useful imformation as a resource for my own website. 
This is a blog post describing the same kind of data that I want to with my website.
It does a great job of showing this data in a meaningful way, and the page flows nicely.
I believe an issue with this example page is trying to do too much. It might be hard to understand.

This site is actually a store but I think it does a good job of displaying different elements to be used.
The CSS doesn't seem to be dynamic and it's easy to break the look of the page by changing the window size.

This is a great beginner guide. I think I want to do something similar but make it more expansive.
